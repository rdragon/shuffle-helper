## View permutation

When you click on "View permutation" on the "Play Settings" page you see a list of N numbers, where N is the number of cards you want to shuffle. These numbers can be interpreted as follows.

Assign each of your N cards from top to bottom a number according to this list of numbers. For example, if the list of numbers equals "3, 1, 2", then the topmost card gets number 3, the middle card gets number 1 and the bottom card gets number 2.

Now, if you shuffle this deck of cards according to the instructions, then the resulting deck will be perfectly sorted. The topmost card in the shuffled deck is the card that was assigned the number 1, the card directly below that card is the card that was assigned the number 2, etc.
