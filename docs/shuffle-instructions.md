## Shuffle instructions

The shuffle requires multiple stages. Each stage starts with a single pile containing all the cards. This initial pile is then spread over multiple other piles according to the pile numbers that are spoken. For each number that is spoken you place the current topmost card of the initial pile on top of the pile that corresponds to the given number.

After all the cards have been dealt out and the initial pile is empty, you combine the separate piles into a single pile again. This is done by stacking the piles on top of each other, with the first pile on the bottom and the last pile on top. The resulting pile will be the initial pile for the next stage, or the final shuffled deck in case of the last stage.

It's important to combine these piles correctly, otherwise the shuffle doesn't work as intended (however, in the last stage it doesn't really matter how you combine the cards).
